# Anthropic Prompt Caching

Anthropic offers many state-of-the-art models from the haiku, sonnet, and opus families.

Read on to learn how to use these models with LlamaIndex!

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.


```python
%pip install llama-index-llms-anthropic
```

#### Set Tokenizer

First we want to set the tokenizer, which is slightly different than TikToken. This ensures that token counting is accurate throughout the library.

**NOTE**: Anthropic recently updated their token counting API. Older models like claude-2.1 are no longer supported for token counting in the latest versions of the Anthropic python client.


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic
from llama_index.core import Settings

tokenizer = Anthropic().tokenizer
Settings.tokenizer = tokenizer
```

## Basic Usage


```python
import os

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
```

You can call `complete` with a prompt:


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

# To customize your API key, do this
# otherwise it will lookup ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from your env variable
# llm = Anthropic(api_key="<api_key>")
llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")

resp = llm.complete("Who is Paul Graham?")
```


```python
print(resp)
```

    **Programming**: He's a respected figure in the programming community, particularly known for his work with Lisp programming language and for co-creating the first web-based application, Viaweb, in the 1990s (which was sold to Yahoo and became Yahoo Store).
    
    **Writing**: Graham is well-known for his thoughtful essays on startups, technology, programming, and society, published on his website paulgraham.com. His essays are widely read in tech circles and cover topics like how to start a startup, the nature of innovation, and social commentary.
    
    **Books**: He's authored several books including "Hackers & Painters" and "On Lisp."
    
    **Influence**: He's considered one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem, both through Y Combinator's impact and his writings on entrepreneurship and technology.
    
    Graham is known for his analytical thinking and contrarian perspectives on business, technology, and culture.


You can also call `chat` with a list of chat messages:


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

messages = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"
    ),
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="Tell me a story"),
]
llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")
resp = llm.chat(messages)

print(resp)
```

    assistant: Ahoy there, matey! *adjusts tricorn hat and strokes beard* 
    
    Let me spin ye a tale from me seafarin' days, when the ocean was as wild as a kraken's temper and twice as unpredictable!
    
    **The Tale of the Singing Compass**
    
    'Twas a foggy mornin' when me crew and I discovered the strangest treasure - not gold or jewels, mind ye, but a compass that hummed sea shanties! Aye, ye heard right! This peculiar little instrument would warble different tunes dependin' on which direction it pointed.
    
    North brought forth a melancholy ballad about lost loves, while South sang a jaunty tune that made even our grumpiest sailor, One-Eyed Pete, tap his peg leg. But here's the curious part - when it pointed West, it sang a mysterious melody none of us had ever heard, with words in an ancient tongue.
    
    Bein' the adventurous sort (and perhaps a wee bit foolish), we followed that western song for three days and three nights. The compass led us through treacherous waters, past islands that seemed to shimmer like mirages, until we reached a hidden cove where the water glowed like liquid emeralds.
    
    And there, me hearty friend, we found the greatest treasure of all - not riches, but a family of merfolk who had been waitin' centuries for someone to return their enchanted compass! They rewarded our kindness with safe passage through any storm and the secret locations of three genuine treasure islands.
    
    *winks and takes a swig from an imaginary bottle*
    
    Sometimes the best adventures come from followin' the strangest songs, savvy?


## Streaming Support

Every method supports streaming through the `stream_` prefix.


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")

resp = llm.stream_complete("Who is Paul Graham?")
for r in resp:
    print(r.delta, end="")
```

## Vertex AI Support

By providing the `region` and `project_id` parameters (either through environment variables or directly), you can use an Anthropic model through Vertex AI.


```python
import os

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_PROJECT_ID"] = "YOUR PROJECT ID HERE"
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_REGION"] = "YOUR PROJECT REGION HERE"
```

Do keep in mind that setting region and project_id here will make Anthropic use the Vertex AI client

## Bedrock Support

LlamaIndex also supports Anthropic models through AWS Bedrock.


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

# Note: this assumes you have standard AWS credentials configured in your environment
llm = Anthropic(
    model="anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0",
    aws_region="us-east-1",
)

resp = llm.complete("Who is Paul Graham?")
```

## Multi-Modal Support

Using `ChatMessage` objects, you can pass in images and text to the LLM.


```python
!wget https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/12/12/20/00/play-6865967_640.jpg -O image.jpg
```


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")

messages = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="user",
        blocks=[
            ImageBlock(path="image.jpg"),
            TextBlock(text="What is in this image?"),
        ],
    )
]

resp = llm.chat(messages)
print(resp)
```

    assistant: This image shows four wooden dice on a dark fabric surface. The dice appear to be made of light-colored wood and have the traditional black dots (pips) marking the numbers on each face. They are scattered casually on what looks like a dark blue or black cloth background.


## Prompt Caching

Anthropic models support the idea of prompt cahcing -- wherein if a prompt is repeated multiple times, or the start of a prompt is repeated, the LLM can reuse pre-calculated attention results to speed up the response and lower costs.

To enable prompt caching, you can set `cache_control` on your `ChatMessage` objects, or set `cache_idx` on the LLM to always cache the first X messages (with -1 being all messages).


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")

# cache individual message(s)
messages = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="user",
        content="<some very long prompt>",
        additional_kwargs={"cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},
    ),
]

resp = llm.chat(messages)

# cache first X messages (with -1 being all messages)
llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0", cache_idx=-1)

resp = llm.chat(messages)
```

## Structured Prediction

LlamaIndex provides an intuitive interface for converting any Anthropic LLMs into a structured LLM through `structured_predict` - simply define the target Pydantic class (can be nested), and given a prompt, we extract out the desired object.


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic
from llama_index.core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List


class MenuItem(BaseModel):
    """A menu item in a restaurant."""

    course_name: str
    is_vegetarian: bool


class Restaurant(BaseModel):
    """A restaurant with name, city, and cuisine."""

    name: str
    city: str
    cuisine: str
    menu_items: List[MenuItem]


llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")
prompt_tmpl = PromptTemplate(
    "Generate a restaurant in a given city {city_name}"
)

# Option 1: Use `as_structured_llm`
restaurant_obj = (
    llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)
    .complete(prompt_tmpl.format(city_name="Miami"))
    .raw
)
# Option 2: Use `structured_predict`
# restaurant_obj = llm.structured_predict(Restaurant, prompt_tmpl, city_name="Miami")
```


```python
restaurant_obj
```




    Restaurant(name='Ocean Breeze Bistro', city='Miami', cuisine='Seafood', menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Grilled Mahi-Mahi with Mango Salsa', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Coconut Shrimp with Pineapple Dipping Sauce', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Key Lime Pie', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Lobster Bisque', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Grilled Vegetable Platter with Chimichurri', is_vegetarian=True)])



#### Structured Prediction with Streaming

Any LLM wrapped with `as_structured_llm` supports streaming through `stream_chat`.


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from IPython.display import clear_output
from pprint import pprint

input_msg = ChatMessage.from_str("Generate a restaurant in San Francisco")

sllm = llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)
stream_output = sllm.stream_chat([input_msg])
for partial_output in stream_output:
    clear_output(wait=True)
    pprint(partial_output.raw.dict())
    restaurant_obj = partial_output.raw

restaurant_obj
```

    {'city': 'San Francisco',
     'cuisine': 'California Fusion',
     'menu_items': [{'course_name': 'Dungeness Crab Cakes', 'is_vegetarian': False},
                    {'course_name': 'Roasted Beet and Arugula Salad',
                     'is_vegetarian': True},
                    {'course_name': 'Grilled Pacific Salmon',
                     'is_vegetarian': False},
                    {'course_name': 'Wild Mushroom Risotto', 'is_vegetarian': True},
                    {'course_name': 'Grass-Fed Beef Tenderloin',
                     'is_vegetarian': False},
                    {'course_name': 'Chocolate Lava Cake', 'is_vegetarian': True}],
     'name': 'Golden Gate Bistro'}





    Restaurant(name='Golden Gate Bistro', city='San Francisco', cuisine='California Fusion', menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Dungeness Crab Cakes', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Roasted Beet and Arugula Salad', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Grilled Pacific Salmon', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Wild Mushroom Risotto', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Grass-Fed Beef Tenderloin', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Chocolate Lava Cake', is_vegetarian=True)])



## Model Thinking

With `claude-3.7 Sonnet`, you can enable the model to "think" harder about a task, generating a chain-of-thought response before writing out the final answer.

You can enable this by passing in the `thinking_dict` parameter to the constructor, specififying the amount of tokens to reserve for the thinking process.


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

llm = Anthropic(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-0",
    # max_tokens must be greater than budget_tokens
    max_tokens=64000,
    # temperature must be 1.0 for thinking to work
    temperature=1.0,
    thinking_dict={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 1600},
)
```


```python
messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="(1234 * 3421) / (231 + 2341) = ?")
]

resp_gen = llm.stream_chat(messages)

for r in resp_gen:
    print(r.delta, end="")

print()
print(r.message.content)
```

    I'll solve this step by step.
    
    First, let me calculate the numerator:
    1234 × 3421 = 4,221,514
    
    Next, let me calculate the denominator:
    231 + 2341 = 2,572
    
    Now I can divide:
    4,221,514 ÷ 2,572 = 1,641.42 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
    
    Therefore: (1234 × 3421) ÷ (231 + 2341) = **1,641.42**
    I'll solve this step by step.

We can also expose the exact thinking process:


```python
print(r.message.additional_kwargs["thinking"]["thinking"])
```

    I need to calculate (1234 * 3421) / (231 + 2341).
    
    Let me do this step by step.
    
    First, let me calculate the numerator: 1234 * 3421
    1234 * 3421
    = 1234 * (3000 + 400 + 20 + 1)
    = 1234 * 3000 + 1234 * 400 + 1234 * 20 + 1234 * 1
    = 3,702,000 + 493,600 + 24,680 + 1,234
    = 4,221,514
    
    Now let me calculate the denominator: 231 + 2341
    231 + 2341 = 2,572
    
    So the expression becomes:
    4,221,514 / 2,572
    
    Let me do this division:
    4,221,514 ÷ 2,572 = 1,641.4...
    
    Let me be more precise:
    4,221,514 ÷ 2,572 = 1,641.42...
    
    Actually, let me double-check my multiplication:
    1234 * 3421
    
    1234
    ×3421
    -----
    1234 (1234 × 1)
    2468 (1234 × 2, shifted one place)
    4936 (1234 × 4, shifted two places)
    3702 (1234 × 3, shifted three places)
    -----
    
    Let me be more careful:
    1234 × 1 = 1234
    1234 × 20 = 24680
    1234 × 400 = 493600
    1234 × 3000 = 3702000
    
    1234 + 24680 + 493600 + 3702000 = 4,221,514
    
    That's correct.
    
    Now 4,221,514 ÷ 2,572 ≈ 1,641.42


## Tool/Function Calling

Anthropic supports direct tool/function calling through the API. Using LlamaIndex, we can implement some core agentic tool calling patterns.


```python
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic
from datetime import datetime

llm = Anthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-0")


def get_current_time() -> dict:
    """Get the current time"""
    return {"time": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}


# uses the tool name, any type annotations, and docstring to describe the tool
tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=get_current_time)
```

We can simply do a single pass to call the tool and get the result:


```python
resp = llm.predict_and_call([tool], "What is the current time?")
print(resp)
```

    {'time': '2025-05-22 12:45:48'}


We can also use lower-level APIs to implement an agentic tool-calling loop!


```python
chat_history = [ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is the current time?")]
tools_by_name = {t.metadata.name: t for t in [tool]}

resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool], chat_history=chat_history)
tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(
    resp, error_on_no_tool_call=False
)

if not tool_calls:
    print(resp)
else:
    while tool_calls:
        # add the LLM's response to the chat history
        chat_history.append(resp.message)

        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            tool_name = tool_call.tool_name
            tool_kwargs = tool_call.tool_kwargs

            print(f"Calling {tool_name} with {tool_kwargs}")
            tool_output = tool.call(**tool_kwargs)
            print("Tool output: ", tool_output)
            chat_history.append(
                ChatMessage(
                    role="tool",
                    content=str(tool_output),
                    # most LLMs like Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. need to know the tool call id
                    additional_kwargs={"tool_call_id": tool_call.tool_id},
                )
            )

            resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool], chat_history=chat_history)
            tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(
                resp, error_on_no_tool_call=False
            )
    print("Final response: ", resp.message.content)
```

    Calling get_current_time with {}
    Tool output:  {'time': '2025-05-22 12:45:51'}
    Final response:  The current time is 12:45:51 on May 22, 2025.


## Server-Side Tool Calling

Anthropic now also supports server-side tool calling in latest versions. 

Here's an example of how to use it:


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

llm = Anthropic(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-0",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "web_search_20250305",
            "name": "web_search",
            "max_uses": 3,  # Limit to 3 searches
        }
    ],
)

# Get response with citations
response = llm.complete("What are the latest AI research trends?")

# Access the main response content
print(response.text)

# Access citations if available
for citation in response.citations:
    print(f"Source: {citation.get('url')} - {citation.get('cited_text')}")
```

    Based on the latest research and industry reports, here are the key AI trends shaping 2025:
    
    ## 1. Agentic AI Takes Center Stage
    
    Agentic AI - AI systems that can perform tasks independently with minimal human intervention - is emerging as the most significant trend for 2025. "Think of agents as the apps of the AI era," according to Microsoft executives. Early implementations will focus on small, structured internal tasks like password changes or vacation requests, with companies being cautious about deploying agents for customer-facing activities involving real money.
    
    ## 2. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities
    
    AI models with advanced reasoning capabilities, like OpenAI's o1, can solve complex problems with logical steps similar to human thinking, making them particularly useful in science, coding, math, law, and medicine. Tech companies are competing to develop frontier models that push boundaries in natural-language processing, image generation, and coding.
    
    ## 3. Focus on Measurable ROI and Enterprise Adoption
    
    In 2025, businesses are pushing harder for measurable outcomes from generative AI: reduced costs, demonstrable ROI, and efficiency gains. Despite over 90% of organizations increasing their generative AI use, only 8% consider their initiatives mature, indicating significant room for growth in practical implementation.
    
    ## 4. Scientific Discovery and Materials Science
    
    AI is increasingly being applied to scientific discovery, with materials science emerging as a promising area following AI's success in protein research. Meta has released massive datasets and models to help scientists discover new materials faster.
    
    ## 5. Multimodal AI and Beyond Chatbots
    
    As AI technology matures, developers and businesses are looking beyond chatbots toward building sophisticated software applications on top of large language models rather than deploying chatbots as standalone tools.
    
    ## 6. Dramatic Cost Reductions
    
    Inference costs are falling dramatically - from $20 per million tokens to $0.07 per million tokens in less than a year, with the cost for GPT-3.5-level performance dropping over 280-fold between November 2022 and October 2024.
    
    ## 7. Closing Performance Gaps
    
    The performance gap between top U.S. and Chinese AI models has narrowed from 9.26% to just 1.70% in one year, while open-weight models are closing the gap with closed models, reducing the performance difference from 8% to 1.7% on some benchmarks.
    
    ## 8. Increased Regulatory Activity
    
    U.S. federal agencies introduced 59 AI-related regulations in 2024 - more than double the number in 2023 - while globally, legislative mentions of AI rose 21.3% across 75 countries.
    
    ## 9. Data Management Revolution
    
    Generative AI is making unstructured data important again, with 94% of data and AI leaders saying AI interest is leading to greater focus on data, driving a "data lakehouse revolution" that combines data lakes' flexibility with data warehouses' structure.
    
    ## 10. Defense and Military Applications
    
    Defense-tech companies are capitalizing on classified military data to train AI models, with mainstream AI companies like OpenAI pivoting toward military partnerships, joining Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in working with the Pentagon.

## Tool Calling + Citations

In `llama-index-core>=0.12.46` + `llama-index-llms-anthropic>=0.7.6`, we've added support for outputting citable tool results!

Using Anthropic, you can now utilize server-side citations to cite specific parts of your tool results.

If the LLM cites a tool result, the citation will appear in the output as a `CitationBlock`, containing the source, title, and cited content.

Let's cover a few ways to do this in practice.

First, let's define a dummy tool/function that returns a citable block.


```python
from llama_index.core import Document
from llama_index.core.llms import CitableBlock, TextBlock
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool

dummy_text = Document.example().text


async def search_fn(query: str):
    """Useful for searching the web to answer questions."""
    return CitableBlock(
        content=[TextBlock(text=dummy_text)],
        title="Facts about LLMs and LlamaIndex",
        source="https://docs.llamaindex.ai",
    )


search_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(search_fn)
```


```python
from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic

llm = Anthropic(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-0",
    # api_key="sk-...",
)
```

### Agents + Citable Tools

You can also use these tools directly in pre-built agents, like the `FunctionAgent`, to get the same citations in the output.


```python
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent

agent = FunctionAgent(
    tools=[search_tool],
    llm=llm,
    # Since we have a fake tool that returns a static result, we don't want to waste LLM tokens
    system_prompt="Only make one search query per user message.",
    timeout=None,
)
```


```python
output = await agent.run("How do LlamaIndex and LLMs work together?")
```


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import CitationBlock

print(output.response.content)
print("----" * 20)
for block in output.response.blocks:
    if isinstance(block, CitationBlock):
        print("Source: ", block.source)
        print("Title: ", block.title)
        print("Cited Content:\n", block.cited_content.text)
        print("----" * 20)
```

    Based on the search results, I can explain how LlamaIndex and LLMs work together:
    
    
    LLMs are a phenomenal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning. They are pre-trained on large amounts of publicly available data. However, there's a key challenge: How do we best augment LLMs with our own private data?
    
    This is where LlamaIndex comes in as the solution. LlamaIndex is a "data framework" to help you build LLM apps. Here's how they work together:
    
    ## Data Integration and Structure
    LlamaIndex offers data connectors to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.) and provides ways to structure your data (indices, graphs) so that this data can be easily used with LLMs.
    
    ## Enhanced Query Interface
    LlamaIndex provides an advanced retrieval/query interface over your data: Feed in any LLM input prompt, get back retrieved context and knowledge-augmented output. This means when you ask a question, LlamaIndex retrieves relevant information from your private data and provides it as context to the LLM, enabling more accurate and personalized responses.
    
    ## Flexible Integration
    LlamaIndex allows easy integrations with your outer application framework (e.g. with LangChain, Flask, Docker, ChatGPT, anything else).
    
    ## User-Friendly Design
    LlamaIndex provides tools for both beginner users and advanced users. The high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code. The lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module (data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, reranking modules), to fit

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Manual Tool Calling + Citations

Using our tool that returns a citable block, we can manually call the LLM with the given tool in a manual agent loop.

Once the LLM stops making tool calls, we can return the final response and parse the citations from the response.


```python
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, CitationBlock

chat_history = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="system",
        # Since we have a fake tool that returns a static result, we don't want to waste LLM tokens
        content="Only make one search query per user message.",
    ),
    ChatMessage(
        role="user", content="How do LlamaIndex and LLMs work together?"
    ),
]
resp = llm.chat_with_tools([search_tool], chat_history=chat_history)
chat_history.append(resp.message)

tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(
    resp, error_on_no_tool_call=False
)
while tool_calls:
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        if tool_call.tool_name == "search_fn":
            tool_result = search_tool.call(tool_call.tool_kwargs)
            chat_history.append(
                ChatMessage(
                    role="tool",
                    blocks=tool_result.blocks,
                    additional_kwargs={"tool_call_id": tool_call.tool_id},
                )
            )

    resp = llm.chat_with_tools([search_tool], chat_history=chat_history)
    chat_history.append(resp.message)
    tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(
        resp, error_on_no_tool_call=False
    )

print(resp.message.content)
print("----" * 20)
for block in resp.message.blocks:
    if isinstance(block, CitationBlock):
        print("Source: ", block.source)
        print("Title: ", block.title)
        print("Cited Content:\n", block.cited_content.text)
        print("----" * 20)
```

    Based on the search results, I can explain how LlamaIndex and LLMs work together:
    
    
    LlamaIndex is a "data framework" to help you build LLM apps
    . The integration works by addressing a key challenge: 
    while LLMs are a phenomenal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning and are pre-trained on large amounts of publicly available data, we need a comprehensive toolkit to help perform data augmentation for LLMs with our own private data
    .

    ## Data Integration
    
    LlamaIndex offers data connectors to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.)
    , allowing you to bring your private data into a format that LLMs can work with.
    
    ## Data Structuring
    
    LlamaIndex provides ways to structure your data (indices, graphs) so that this data can be easily used with LLMs
    . This structuring is crucial for making your data accessible and searchable by the LLM.
    
    ## Enhanced Querying
    
    LlamaIndex provides an advanced retrieval/query interface over your data: Feed in any LLM input prompt, get back retrieved context and knowledge-augmented output
    . This means when you ask the LLM a question, LlamaIndex retrieves relevant information from your data and provides it as context to enhance the LLM's response.
    
    ## Application Integration
    
    LlamaIndex allows easy integrations with your outer application framework (e.g. with LangChain, Flask, Docker, ChatGPT, anything else)
    , making it flexible to incorporate into existing systems.
    
    The framework is designed to be accessible to users at different levels:
